# Welcome to the Recipe Saver iOS app!

As a beginner iOS developer, I created this app to help people easily save and organize their favorite recipes.

## Features

- Add new recipes with ingredients and instructions
- View a list of all your saved recipes
- Categorize each recipe you add

## Getting Started

To use the app, simply clone this repository and open the project in Xcode. From there, you can run the app on your iOS device or simulator.

I hope you find Recipe Saver useful and please feel free to share any feedback or suggestions for improvement. Thank you for using the app!
